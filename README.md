# Discord-OLLAMA-LLAVA-Bot
used LLAVA from OLLAMA to create this bot, to interact with the bot just mention it in any message and it will reply, to get description of any image just send it in the general channel and the bot will provide you a general short description of the image, reply to the bots reply to keep the conversation going, the bot also maintains the context in the conversation, and the ollama is being hosted on ngrok and we just feed the model by getting the access to host, just look at the code you will understand


UPDATE--

added voice convo with the bot, you can send .ogg or mp3 files to the channel and the bot will respond accordingly, Used Wshisper from open ai its, used the tiny model because i was running whisper locally on my pc as it is not resource heavy
